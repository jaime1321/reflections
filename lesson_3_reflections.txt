When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are collaborating with others you must push changes to the remote so others can pull these down to their local working directories
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes automatically may introduce changes in the code you are currently working with - this is better dealt with when you are ready for it to see what effect it has.
